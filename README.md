#Customer Churn Prediction
##Overview
This project aims to build a classifier to predict customer churn. Using a dataset from Kaggle with 10,000 samples.
I performed a thorough analysis and visualization of the attributes to understand the data better. 

The target variable for prediction is 'exited', indicating whether a customer has churned.

###I employed several machine learning algorithms for this task, including:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Decision Trees
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Through this project, we aimed to find the most effective model for predicting customer churn.
